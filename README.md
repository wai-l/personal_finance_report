## Project Overview

## Data Cleaning / ETL (Python):
Used Python to clean and preprocess monthly Spendee exports. The process consolidated multiple files into a single master dataset, forming the ETL layer for a downstream Shiny dashboard.

### Interactive Dashboard (R):
An interactive Quarto Shiny dashboard is built using R to provide a visual breakdown of spending and income by category for each month.
The dashboard allows users to explore trends, identify patterns, and view detailed visualizations of their financial data.
